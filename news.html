      <p class="news">The restaurant kicks of the summer with a fundraiser for
        the San Diego Unified School District to support the arts/music program
        in inner city schools. The dinner included fine cuisine including: rosemary
        potatoes, lamb chops, and parmesan asparagus. Proceeds from the event will be used
        to buy instruments, art canvases, and gallons of paint. Students and their families
        were also invited to perform the national anthem in front of their first live audience.
        <br>
        <br>
        In addition, there was an art show that took place after the dinner, where guests
        could purchase the student's art as well as request commissions from the students.
        The school district was able to raise over $4,000 with the event, and the schools
        are planning on creating a few new art classes for the high schools, as well as the elementary schools.
        With the help of the event, the school district will be able to buy the art supplies
        for the students to use in class.

      <p class="news">The staff got together in order to provide the homeless
        people in Downtown a meal fit for kings and queens. After the meal, the guests
        attended a seminar to learn about career opportunities in their restaurant
        as well as get a hands-on lesson with a professional chef.
          <br><br>
          Guests who were interested
        in any of the positions, were welcomed back to the restaurant for a tour around the kitchen
        as well as the dining room area. Attendees learned how to cook simple dishes using
        only a few ingredients as well as learned how to setup for a dinner rush quickly.


        The restaurant also rented out a nearby home for the week so that attendees
        could take a hot shower, get some rest, and read up on some of the interview
        books that were left for them in their rooms. The restaurant is hopeful
        that the guests will be able to get back on their feet and back into the
        workforce soon.
